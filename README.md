# 'Files'

In the months leading up to iOS 11, I was working on a file browser for iOS called 'Files'. It featured a resizable multi-window UI with snapping, minimization and window controls. It was very much a work in progress, not production-ready code.

I ran a successful TestFlight for a while, until I received a phone call from Apple telling me in no uncertain terms that the app wasn't going to happen. I dropped development, and haven't touched it since. Apple soon thereafter released their own 'Files' app for iOS, with, amusingly, a near-identical icon, and I moved on to other projects.

Previously a Patren reward, I figured I would post it here rather than let it quietly succumb to bit rot.
